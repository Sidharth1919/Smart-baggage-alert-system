# Smart-baggage-alert-system
The Smart Baggage Alert System is an IoT-based solution designed to enhance luggage security and prevent loss or theft in public and other areas.
This system leverages the ESP32 module, a powerful microcontroller board with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, to track and monitor bags in real-time. By establishing a connection between the ESP32 module and a mobile device via Wi-Fi, the system provides instant alerts whenever a bag is left behind and moves outside a predefined range.
